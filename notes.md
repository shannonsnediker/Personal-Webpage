## A build tool: a local server environment
- when testing applications and building websites you dont want to do that on a remote server on the internet for security reasons. So you install a build tool that creates a local and secure server environment

it will build the final website and do things like optimizations, cache breaking, source mapping, run a local server, we can add plugins
